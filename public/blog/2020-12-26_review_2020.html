      <h3>2020 In Review</h3>
      <p>
        2020 has been a good year for me with respect to my coding career and I wanted to write a blog post detailing some of the areas 
        that I've grown in and some of the areas that need work. Looking at my list of goals that I set for myself at the beginning of 
        the year, I'd say I did an ok job at completing them. I worked primarily on projects and spent less time reading textbooks that 
        I wanted to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the beginning of the year, I worked on the python project in the Python Crash Course textbook and then about halfway through 
        the year I tackled the React project from Lighthouse Labs. Once I finished that, I wanted to put all my focus into making progress 
        toward the structural analysis project and this is when I stopped reading the textbooks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also started out the year teaching the introduction to front end development for Lighthouse Labs until the beginning of March. 
        That was such a great experience for me. I ended up refreshing my knowledge of all the basics of html and css. I enjoyed seeing 
        the lightbulb moment in student's eyes when something clicked and I would definitely like to teach again in the future if the 
        opportunity ever comes up.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following sections I dive a little deeper into some of the topics.
      </p>
      <h5>Structural Analysis Project</h5>
      <p>
        This project has been quite challenging but it's always been within reach. This is very important for motivation - if the work 
        was too complicated, I would have a hard time staying motivated to work on it and I would have had to reach out for help quite 
        a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first big obstacle I ran into was how I was going to visually display the input information on screen dynamically as the user 
        fills out the form. I did a bit of research and found that I had 2 main option: using canvas or SVG. Something led me down the 
        path of option two and it has worked out quite well. The project can now display all the user's input information as a visual 
        diagram of the structure with the forces and restraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next challenge has been working with the various requests to and from the sever, and handling various errors and redirects. 
        Although this is mostly solved now, I'm still working on covering some edges cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last major challenge has been writing the client-side and server-side validation code. I was stuck on this part for quite a 
        while. I even asked for some help which I didn't get the answer from but it led me to find the solution myself eventually. This 
        ties into the second challenge in that I had to handle the cases where the input data failed validation and needed to be 
        redirected and an error needed to be thrown.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would say that this project is at roughly the 85% complete mark. There are a number of additional features that I may or may 
        not end up adding but the 15% for work remaining is to get me to a viable product that I can host and share with people to try out.
      </p>
      <h5>Coding at Work</h5>
      <p>
        Since the month of March, we've all been working remotely and I haven't seen my coworkers. I was quite worried about how I was 
        going to continue learning from others if I can't go up to them and talk face to face. But working remotely has proven to be not 
        as bad as I thought it would be and I find the process of working though problems or question through screen sharing a great 
        experience so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        At work, I'm spent most of the year wrestling with our code base trying to understand it as best I can. Being somewhat of a 
        perfectionist, it's really hard to accept that I don't understand the entire codebase.
      </p>
      <h5>Textbooks</h5>
      <p>
        I did finish a couple textbooks this year but I didn't read nearly as much as I would have liked to. I'm still partway through 
        reading all the books that are on my goals list. I will be making a push early in 2021 to read more. I think I need to establish 
        some structure to get the reading done, something like committing to reading a chapter a week.
