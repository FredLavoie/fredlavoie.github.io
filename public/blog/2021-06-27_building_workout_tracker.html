    <h3>Building Workout Tracker</h3>
    <p>
      Most of the apps I've built so far have been demos. They were built to learn new skills and display them in my
      portfolio. This is great of course, but I've been wanting to build something practical and I haven't found what
      app I wanted to build until now - a workout tracking app.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past several years, I've been writing my workouts in a paper book, and more recently in a txt file in my
      OneDrive. I've also always added a calendar entry for each workout in a "Workout" calendar I have setup in
      Outlook. The shift to a txt file was to be able to search through my workouts to find past numbers or times, and
      the calendar was to get an overview of how many workouts I'm doing each month and each year. This makeshift system
      worked, but I don't love it and it includes a lot of manual work. I've looked around for an existing app, but
      no app did exactly what I wanted, so I decided to create my own.
    </p>

    <h5>Choosing the stack</h5>
    <p>
      Although I wanted this app mainly as a functional tool, I also knew it could be a great learning opportunity. I
      wanted to use React, not only to keep up my skills up with the framework, but also to hopefully push my knowledge
      and skills a little further. For the back end, I chose Django for a couple reasons: 1- I'm still
      learning Python and this would allow me to further develop my Python skills, 2- it's known to be a "batteries
      included" framework which should hopefully make it easier to make it secure, and 3- it has an ORM which I thought
      would help speed up the development of the backend API.
    </p>
    <h5>Coding the app</h5>
    <p>
      I started by building out the api following along with a couple books by William S. Vincent which were a huge
      help. I mainly followed his Django for APIs book and then used the Docker section, the custom user model section
      and the security/deployment sections of the Django for Professionals book. After about 3 weeks I had an API that I
      could work with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving on to the front end code, I didn't have a clue what I wanted the app to look like or what kind of pages it
      should have. I started out by choosing the Material-UI library to build out the UI. This made things a lot faster
      to build since they have a lot of pre-configured components that are ready to use. I built out the login, password
      change and logout functionality first. Then I moved on to what I consider the most interesting part - the calendar
      page. Once I added the create, update, delete pages for the workouts and records, I was mostly done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front end took about 5 weeks to complete. There were still a lot of rough edges at that point, especially when
      it came to mobile despite building it with responsiveness at every step, but at this point I wanted to get it
      deployed so that I could use is as soon as possible while ironing out bugs and issues as I go.
    </p>
    <h5>Deployment</h5>
    <p>
      This proved to be the most challenging part of the whole project. I was originally planning to deploy it to Heroku
      for what I thought would be the simplest avenue, but upon researching and starting down this road, I quickly
      realized that this would not be ideal for me. It would give me less control over the entire deployment process,
      and, as I found out eventually, would rob me of a huge opportunity to learn new skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first major hurdle I encountered was to dockerize my Django server. This was not strictly necessary, but I
      decided to following the advice of someone much more experienced than me. This was mostly a challenge because I
      didn't start out developing with the server in a Docker container, so I ran into several issues with dependencies
      that I had install inside the pipenv and other outside. I also struggled to get all my environment variables in
      the right places and the right configuration to be able to use the same docker-compose file for both development
      and production. Ultimately, after playing around with it, I got it all working.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of production, once I was done dockerizing my server and the postgres database, I worked on setting up
      the services in a Linux box on Digitalocean. This box is just a Linux machine with an IP address that I can access
      from my terminal. I setup the various services I needed (Docker, git, Node, Nginx, etc...) and started setting up
      the docker containers. There was quite a bit of research going on and I had to make sure to document everything I
      was doing in case I need to retrace my steps, or reconfigure something at a later time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last big hurtle I faced was to setup and configure Nginx. It turned out to not be that complicated, but there
      was a lot of trial-and-error in trying to get things working with the static React files and the Django admin
      panel. I had to understand at a high level, the architecture of my application and how all the pieces fit
      together, and especially how Nginx fits into the picture. This is because I've spent most of my time working with
      servers being run locally and not publicly facing.
    </p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>
      I learned a ton of new things with this project. Before I started, I felt pretty shaky (at best) with React,
      because although I had done three projects with the framework so far, I still didn't quite get it. Now, I feel
      like it's clicked in my mind. I'm also a lot more comfortable working with Docker, creating a Dockerfile and
      docker-compose files. And lastly, I really enjoyed taking a project from conception to deployment; being
      responsible for the visual design and layout, the database design, all of the development work and the deployment
      process.
