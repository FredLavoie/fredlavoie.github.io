      <h3>Implementing dark theme using CSS</h3>
      <p>
        One of the features I wanted to add to this website for a while now is a dark theme. In keeping with the simplistic philosophy 
        of the website, I also wanted to find a way of accomplishing this without using CSS and/or Javascript libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, I figured I would add a toggle button that lets the user choose what they would prefer. It never occurred to me that 
        the browser could check the system theme on the users' computer or phone and set the website theme based on this settings. But 
        once I started researching ways of implementing a dark theme, I quickly came across this method and decided to go with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using CSS media queries and a property called <code class="inline-code">prefers-color-scheme</code>, which allows you to have 
        specific styling based on the system theme (light, dark or no-preference), I started writing the style for the dark theme of this 
        site. One of the first things I did, was to determine how widely supported the feature was (or not) using 
        <a class="blog-link" href="https://caniuse.com">this</a> tool. I was pleasantly surprised to see that most desktop and mobile 
        browsers support it. From my understanding, if the browser does not support the feature, it will ignore the CSS inside the media 
        query and simply show the default styling.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this point on, it was a matter of choosing the colours for the dark theme. I really prefer site or apps that use a really 
        dark grey instead of pure black, as it feels less jarring to me, so I went with this route. Overall, it didn't take very long to 
        get a result that I was mostly happy with. I did however, run into a couple issues however.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, the purple accent I had chosen for my default styling was a bit too dark for the dark theme as it didn't provide enough 
        contrast with the dark grey background. I therefore chose to use a lighter purple. Simple enough fix. The other issue I ran into 
        was a bit trickier to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The svg icon files have their colours set in the file itself and so I couldn't override then with CSS. I could have used two 
        different version of each icon, but that seems cumbersome to me. I was able to find a method of using a CSS property called filter 
        to, filter an image. With a little bit of trial-and-error, I was able to match the svg fill colour with the font colour I had 
        chosen for the dark theme. Admittedly, this is a bit of a band-aid solution, but it allows me to have two different fill colours 
        for the same svg, which I think is a good compromise.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the outset, I imagined that implementing a dark theme would be a lot more work than it turned out to be. I'll keep refining the 
        styling over time. For now, I'm happy with what I achieved in a short amount of time.
