        <h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
        <p>
          These past few months have been interesting. I've been working full time at home and it's been fun.
          I'm a little lazier than normal (in pajamas all day) but I haven't had any trouble getting my 
          work done or staying focused when I'm working through a tough problem. We're supposed to find out 
          in September what the plan will be moving forward in terms of working in the office and/or working 
          from home. I'm hoping that I can settle into a routine of 2-3 days working from home, 2-3 days 
          working in the office. For me, this seems like a good balance.
        </p>

          I recently finished the new React project from lighthouse Labs which was a great learning 
          experience. This project teaches React with hooks and functional components, unlike the class 
          components I was taught when I first learned React. I definitely feel like I have a better 
          understanding of developing with React. Someday I'd like to build a React Native application 
          to further build my knowledge of React.
        </p>

          I've been lagging behind on my reading so far this year and I want to pick that back up in the 
          second half of 2020. I don't intend to become a database administrator, but I really enjoy getting 
          better with SQL and I think it's highly valuable, so I look forward to completing the exercises 
          in the Practical SQL book. Rounding out my Javascript knowledge with a few other books is going 
          to be really useful as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for hobbies, I built myself a powerful desktop computer in May, and installed Ubuntu 20.04 
          along with Windows 10. I now use my Ubuntu machine for all my personal development work, and 
          the Windows machine for playing games. I really enjoy using Ubuntu for coding, it's been a 
          great experience.
        </p>
        <p> 
          I also have been trying to exercise every single day, and I try to get outside as often as 
          I can. We've been going on these long 1-3 hours long walks through the greenbelt which have 
          been a lot of fun. We've also been running 1-2 times a week through the same trails. Otherwise, 
          I do as much strength work as I can in my small apartment and use the Bike Erg for endurance 
          training.
