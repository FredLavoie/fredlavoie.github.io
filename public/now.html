        <h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
        <p>
          At the beginning of January, a friend started working on a stocks bot for our group's discord server. When he mentioned he started 
          building it, I immediately asked him if I could contribute. The stack he had chosen is Django and PostgreSQL. Given that I wanted 
          to make a push to work with Python, I was really happy with his choice. Over the following weeks we continued to improve the bot, 
          take suggestions from the users (our other friends) and make it into something that we all enjoy using. And although the app is 
          not in a public repo, this has definitely given me a taste of what collaborating with others on a project is like.
        </p>
        <p>
          To give you a quick overview of what it does, the bot is called every hour that the stock market is open and provides basic 
          information about the share price, and it's daily change in both dollar amount and percentage. The bot also has a variety of emojis 
          to display based on the amount of change to a stocks' share price. The stocks that we follow in determined by the users who can add 
          symbols to the database to be followed. Currently, we display information for stocks on the US and Canadian exchanges.
        </p>
        <p>
          More recently, I've really gotten into home networking. I'm learning all about routers, switches, access points, racks, UPS, patch 
          panels, etc... I really enjoy learning about this subject. It can be really intimating at first, as there is a lot to learn, but 
          the more I learn the more this world starts making sense to me.
