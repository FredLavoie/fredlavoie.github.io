      <h3>2021 Goals</h3>
      <p>
        At the end of February 2021, I will be starting my third year of coding! It's hard to believe that it's already
        been two years. I'm glad that I still really enjoy learning new technologies, solving problems with code and
        refining the tools that I work with everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year I want to continue refining my Javascript skills and knowledge while at the same time working with
        Python enough to stay proficient with it. I want to work my way through <em>Automate The Boring Stuff with
          Python</em> while at the same time work on a side project using the API at the brokerage firm I use. This will
        help me put into practice the things I'm learning in the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also want to spend a bit more time reading textbook this year. This is not something that I think I'll be
        doing every year forever, but I think that at this point in my development, they are very valuable as a learning
        tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        My structural analysis project is nearly complete and I want to make sure I take it across the finish line this
        year. I started it the week I got back from Lighthouse Labs in September 2019, and I don't want to put this off
        any longer. If all goes well, I'll have it deployed somewhere and I'll try to get some engineering students to
        try it out and hopefully use it for their coursework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, I'd like to either contribute to an open source project or an internal tool at my job. A big part of my
        motivation in doing something like this is that I want to collaborate with others in a less structured way
        (compared to regular career work) where the goal is to building something great that people will enjoy using.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>Update (2021-05-19):</h5>
      <p>
        As things often do in life, my goals have shifted slightly since I started off the year. I've shifted gears a
        bit and am now spending most of my free coding time working on my workout tracking app. The reason is quite
        simple - I want to start using this app. Luckily, this presents a great opportunity to deppen and solidify my
        Python/Django knowledge as well as my React knowledge in working on this app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I finish and deploy this app, I'll move back to my structural analysis app which is about 95% done and just
        needs that last big push to take it over the finish line (and deploy it!).
      </p>
