        <h3>2021 Goals</h3>
        <p>
          At the end of February 2021, I will be starting my third year of coding! It's hard to believe that's it's already been two years. 
          I'm glad that I still really enjoy learning new technologies, solving problems with code and refining the tools that I work with 
          everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year I want to continue refining my Javascript skills and knowledge while at the same time working with Python enough to stay 
          proficient with it. I want to work my way through <em>Automate The Boring Stuff with Python</em> while at the same time work on a 
          side project using the API at the brokerage firm I use. This will help me put into practice the things I'm learning in the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also want to spend a bit more time reading textbook this year. This is not something that I think I'll be doing every year 
          forever, but I think that at this point in my development, they are very valuable as a learning tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          My structural analysis project is nearly complete and I want to make sure I take it across the finish line this year. I started it 
          the week I got back from Lighthouse Labs in September 2019, and I don't want to put this off any longer. If all goes well, I'll 
          have it deployed somewhere and I'll try to get some engineering students to try it out and hopefully use it for their coursework.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I'd like to either contribute to an open source project or an internal tool at my job. A big part of my motivation in 
          doing something like this is that I want to collaborate with others in a less structured way (compared to regular career work) 
          where the goal is to building something great that people will enjoy using.
        </p>
