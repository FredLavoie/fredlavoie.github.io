        <h3>What I'm doing now:</h3>
				<h4>Web development career</h4>
				<br>
        <p>
					I’m still working hard to familiarize myself with the application and the development processes 
					at work. I’m getting to know my coworkers more and it’s always fun to come into work.
        </p>
				<h4>Side projects</h4>
				<br>
        <p>
					I’m still working away at my structural analysis project. Initially I thought about rewriting it 
					in Ruby or Python, but after looking over the code, I don’t remember Fortran well enough to understand 
					it and translate it to a language I’m still learning. So I decided to refactor the Fortran code to 
					write a second output file as a stringified version of JSON, which the server can parse. That’s the 
					direction I’m going with.
				</p>
				<p>
					This past weekend I built a web scraping tool to get all the workouts posted by my old gym and save 
					it to a text file. This we fun and now I have a library of workout to choose from. It was a good 
					learning experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					I decided to start learning Python and I bought a book to get me started. The book is Python Crash 
					Course by Eric Matthes. It’s by the same publisher as Eloquent Javascript.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love javascript and web development, but I also wanted to learn a good general purpose language. 
					I already learned a bit of Ruby at the bootcamp, and I was torn between these tho, but ultimately 
					decided that Python was the better, future proof choice. 
				</p>
				<h4>Life</h4>
				<br>
        <p>
					We’re finally moved in at our new place. We’re getting into the groove of things and settling into 
					a routine. My ‘battlestation’ is all set up now. It’s really enjoyable to code and play at my desk 
					with is right in front of a huge window that spans most of the length of our apartment.
				</p>
				<p>
					We’re also going to the gym regularly and enjoying all the amenities. We enjoy spending 15 minutes 
					in the sauna after every workout.
