        <h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
				<h4>Web development career</h4>
				<br>
        <p>
          I'm currently working a lot with SQL and learning how to make changes to the application 
          while maintaining and/or migrating production data. This is definitely challenging my SQL 
          knowledge and so I've started working through my <em>Practical SQL</em> book.
        </p>
				<p>
          I feel like I'm finally getting a hold of all the major tasks that I need to be able to do 
          at work. I still have a couple more big things to learn that I haven't touched yet, but 
          overall I feel good about my progress. I'm able to get things done more efficiently now 
          without having to ask for help too often.
				</p>
				<h4>Side projects</h4>
				<br>
        <p>
          Since the beginning of January, I've been teaching an intro to front end development 
          course twice a week. This has taken a lot of my time that I normally would be putting into 
          working on side projects. Now that the course is done, I want to get back to working on my 
          side projects.
