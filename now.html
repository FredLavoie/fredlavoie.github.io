                <h2>What I'm doing now</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    In December, along with all other Canadian employees, I was laid off from Rhumbix. It was a real
                    shock and completely unexpected. On the bright side, this gives me a lot of time to learn and
                    improve my software developement skills. I'm lucky that this career, if I continue to push hard on
                    building my knowledge and working on personal projects, I can be a better developer once I re-enter
                    the workforce than when I was forced out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a long list of things I want to learn and work on, my workout tracker project has a lot of
                    things that could be improved, and same goes for my structural analysis project
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's what I'm planning to work on for now. I may adjust a couple things as I go, like spending
                    more time on data structures and algorithms if I have coding tests coming up.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Continue working on the advanced React course. As I learn new things, I'll apply anything that I
                        think would be an improvement to my workout tracker app.
                    </li>
                    <li>Migrate my workout tracker app from Create-React-app to Vite</li>
                    <li>
                        Update this personal website (if there's a dark theme, you're seeing the new and updated
                        version!)
                    </li>

                    <li>Finish reading the Practical SQL textbook I have and take notes for future reference</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I'm also taking the opportunity to work on my health and fitness by working out on a daily basis and
                    maintaining a good sleep schedule.
                </p>
